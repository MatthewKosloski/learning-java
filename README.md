## Running Java Programs & Watching for Changes

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Java installed, check by running `java -version`
- Install [entr](https://bitbucket.org/eradman/entr/) package with `brew install entr`

## Watching (automatic)

The following runs the program `Countdown` in the `chapter_two` folder and watches for changes:

```
bash java.bash chapter_two Countdown
```

Or, if you want to compile and run the Java program manually (in chapter directory):

```
javac Countdown.java && java Countdown
```

## Running Applets

The following displays the `Einstein` applet in a new window:

```
bash applet.bash chapter_two Einstein
```
